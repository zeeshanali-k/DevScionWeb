This is a Kotlin/Compose Multiplatform portfolio project targeting Web (Kotlin/Wasm). This is Web
first project and can be used as a resource for developing Web projects in Compose Multiplatform.
Although there is an Android module added in the project and project runs fine on Android, but it
was only added for testing purposes since in Web we don't get clear error message of crashes.
